We just added Blinds to Picovico's public list of styles and that means you can now make videos using it. The style is inspired from the blinds curtains that we see at most of the workplaces. There is a lot to see behind those stripes-like things covering our windows and we want to you to look beyond and show it to the world. Since this style has simple effects and bold black/white colors, it makes a nice choice for business videos. Try it out today and if you want to share your work with us, simply mention @picovico on social platforms.

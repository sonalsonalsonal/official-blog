New Year&#39;s Day is just around the corner. It&#39;s a time for celebration, new beginnings and most of all, reflection on all the ups and downs in life from the previous year.

It&#39;s been really amazing seeing how people have used our [Year-Book](https://web.picovico.com/en/video/styles/newyear) video style last year to create amazing festive flashback videos and shared them with their friends, family and dear ones. This year again, with a lot of enchanting flavors, we&#39;ve released one brand new video style, [Party](https://web.picovico.com/en/video/styles/party).

Party is a rocking new video style featuring a spectrum-inspired frame that displays your party photos in a spectacular dancing form. Designed especially for New Year, this very styleâ€™s presentation and effects will capture your New Year party in a full, lascivious splendor.
